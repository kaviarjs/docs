        Every framework should be open to be shaped by the community, and we
        shape the future by the courage of our questions... and the depth of our

        Working at a company's project, that's for money. Working open-source
        that's for your programmer soul. Join us in our adventure, contribute to
        open-source, evolve as a human being and coder. Lots of companies
        recognise open-source developers as very valuable assets.
