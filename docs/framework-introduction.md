## What is Kaviar?

KaviarJS is a TypeScript-based framework which aims at helping developers create robust web applications <strong>in a speedy fashion</strong>. Features cool stuff such as:

- Modular design with Dependency Injection
- Built-in security module compatible with any database
- React Templated Email Support
- Supports running commands from your cli in your application context
- Customisable GraphQL Features
- Complex, yet simple Model Validation
- Customisable Logging

KaviarJS is flexible and does not dictate what database or API should you use. It's flexible to adapt to any needs and provides you with a solid foundation for your project. On top of this solid base, we built X-framework. All open-source.

## X-Framework

This represents a set of bundles (modules) built with Kaviar which make use of:

- GraphQL (Apollo/Serverless)
- MongoDB

Main features of it are:

- Intelligent and adaptive scaffolding tool (@kaviar/x)
- Plug-in Secure User Management (register/login/reset password, etc)
- Out of the box realtime features
- Type-safe MongoDB with relational features.
- GraphQL tools (authorisation, live data, dependency injection, security)

## Learning Curve

It's a great idea to know both JavaScript and TypeScript. But don't feel bad if you haven't ascended yet to godhood (TypeScript), you're a developer you can learn it as you go! It's important that your [JavaScript Basics](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics) are there so you can easily follow through. Besides JS Basics, we recommend you understand the following concepts:

- [Classes in JavaScript](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Classes)
- [Observer Pattern](https://webdevstudios.com/2019/02/19/observable-pattern-in-javascript)
- [Promises](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/javascript-es6-promises-for-beginners-resolve-reject-and-chaining-explained/)
- [Dependency Injection](https://www.infoworld.com/article/2974298/exploring-the-dependency-injection-principle.html)

We also recommend you use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) as your default code formatting tool, this will help you keep your code looking clean without having to think about it.

It would be a good idea to learn the Foundation of Kaviar before diving into X-Framework. This will help sedimentate the principles faster.
