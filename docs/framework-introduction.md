## What is Kaviar?

KaviarJS is a TypeScript-based framework which aims at helping developers create robust web applications <strong>in a speedy fashion</strong>. Features cool stuff such as:

- Built-in Security Module compatible with any database
- Modular Design with Dependency Injection
- React Templated Email Support
- Supports running commands from your cli in your application context
- Customisable GraphQL Features
- Complex, yet simple Model Validation
- Customisable Logging

KaviarJS is flexible and does not dictate what database or API should you use. It's flexible to adapt to any needs and provides you with a solid foundation for your project. On top of this solid base, we built X-framework. All open-source.

## X-Framework

This represents a set of bundles (modules) built with Kaviar which make use of:

- GraphQL (Apollo/Serverless)
- MongoDB

Main features of it are:

- Intelligent and adaptive scaffolding tool (@kaviar/x)
- Plug-in Secure User Management (register/login/reset password, etc)
- Out of the box realtime features
- Type-safe MongoDB with relational features.
- GraphQL tools (authorisation, live data, dependency injection, security)

## Learning Curve

It's a great idea to know both JavaScript and TypeScript. But don't feel bad if you haven't ascended yet to godhood (TypeScript), you're a developer you can learn it as you go! It's important that your JavaScript basics are there so you can easily follow through. Besides JS Basics, we recommend you understand the following concepts.

- OOP in JavaScript
- Observer Pattern
- Promises

We also recommend you use Prettier as your default code formatting tool, this will help you keep your code looking clean without having to think about it.
