A powerful and lightweight module composition strategy responsible for orchestrating your logic, enabling you to easily respect SOLID principles within your infinitely scalable app.

## Install

```bash
npm install --save @kaviar/core
```

## Basic Setup

The kernel is what orchestrates all of your bundles.

```typescript
import { Kernel } from "@kaviar/core";
const kernel = new Kernel();

kernel.init().then(() => {
  console.log("Kernel has been initialised.");
});
```

The Kernel is nothing without bundles. Bundles contain the logic.

```typescript
import { Bundle } from "@kaviar/core";

class AppBundle extends Bundle {
  async init() {
    // This is invoked when kernel is initialised
    console.log("I have been initialised");
  }
}
```

You can add the bundle to the `kernel` in the constructor or later on:

```typescript
const kernel = new Kernel({
  bundles: [new AppBundle()],
});

// Add bundles outside constructor
kernel.addBundle(new OtherBundle());

kernel.init().then(() => {
  // ...
});
```

Initialisation process prepares and initialiases all the bundles registered inside it. You can regard your `Bundles` as groups of independent logic or strongly separated concerns.

Before we dive further into bundles and how we can manage them better, let's learn a bit about Dependency Injection (DI).

## Dependency Injection

### Introduction

An oversimplification of D.I. is that you don't depend on "real" implementations, you depend on references. For example, let's say you have a container that contains everything you need in your app, connection to the database, credentials, anything. And let's say you want to access the database service to do an insert, so instead of getting the service directly (by new-int it, or accessing the singleton), you use the container:

```ts
class MyDatabaseService {
  insert() {
    // Do something
  }
}

// You can get the container from `kernel.container`
container.set("database_service", MyDatabaseService);

// Note that it will instantiate the class you have set
const databaseService = container.get("database_service");
databaseService.insert({
  /* ... */
});
```

Now let's say the `databaseService` needs some credentials and a host to connect to. So instead of using a string directly or reading directly from env, it reads it from container:

```ts
container.set("database_uri", process.env.DATABASE_URI);

class DatabaseService {
  constructor(@Inject("database_uri") databaseUri) {
    // Just a sample for illustration
    this.client = mongodb.connect(databaseUri);
  }
}
```

Now when we fetch DatabaseService from the container, it will automatically inject the dependencies.

So, we never instantiate via `new` we only fetch instances of our services through the container, and there's only one container which is provided by the `Kernel`. Above we showed how to use references as strings (`database_uri`, `database_service`) but references can be classes themselves or (as we'll see later on) tokens.

### Services

```typescript
import { Service } from "@kaviar/core";

const container = kernel.container;

@Service()
class B {}

@Service()
class A {
  // Automatic injection, you don't need to specify @Inject()
  constructor(b: B) {
    this.b = b;
  }
}
```

Now let's use them:

```typescript
const a = container.get(A); // note, A is the className, a is the instance
(instanceof a.b) === B; // true, a.b is an instance of B
```

Services are singletons, meaning it instantiates only once:

```typescript
const a = container.get(A);
a === container.get(A); // true
```

### Parameters

You can also specify a list of parameters to the kernel, that can later be retrieved from the container

```js
new Kernel({
  parameters: {
    // Just some examples, they can be anything
    APPLICATION_URL: "https://www.google.com/",
    DEBUG: true,
  },
});

// Fetching them is getting the string wrapped in %%
const applicationUrl = container.get("%APPLICATION_URL%");

// Or you can get them via kernel.parameters
```

You can inject parameters from kernel, or others like this:

```typescript
@Service()
class A {
  // Inject via property, Note: it uses a function
  @Inject(() => "%DEBUG%")
  protected isDebug: boolean;

  // Inject via constructor
  constructor(@Inject("%APPLICATION_URL%") applicationUrl: string) {
    // Do something based on the context
  }
}
```

### Tokens

If you want to avoid having strings collide, you should use tokens as references:

```ts
import { Inject, Token } from "@kaviar/core";

const MY_SERVICE_TOKEN = new Token();

container.set(MY_SERVICE_TOKEN, B); // A simple B class
class A {
  // Property injection will be set after constructor
  @Inject(MY_SERVICE_TOKEN)
  b: B;

  // OR

  constructor(@Inject(MY_SERVICE_TOKEN) b: B) {
    // Both solutions work well (property injection/constructor injection)
    // Just do what you feel is easier
  }
}
```

## Async Event Management

This technique allows us to have typesafety for Event Management, and event handlers can be async and can be blocking for the event propagation.

```typescript
import { EventManager, Event } from "@kaviar/core";

class UserCreatedEvent extends Event<{
  // This is what information you need to pass when creating the event
  // It can be omitted if events don't store any data
  userId: string;
}> {}

const manager = container.get(EventManager);

manager.addListener(UserCreatedEvent, e => {
  // The data provided in event's constructor is found in event.data property
  console.log(e.data.userId);
});

manager.emit(
  new UserCreatedEvent({
    userId: "XXX",
  })
);
```

Note that you also have `removeListener`, `addGlobalListener` and `removeGlobalListener`, also you can set the order in which the handlers are executed:

```typescript
manager.addListener(
  UserCreatedEvent,
  async e => {
    // Do something before any other handler executes
  },
  {
    order: -1000, // the lowest get executed first, by default order = 0
  }
);
```

You can also add a filter to the option, that will only allow certain "instances" of events. Let's say everytime you insert an object into the database you emit an event that contains also the collectionName in it. And you would like to listen to events for a certain collection:

```typescript
class ObjectInsertedEvent extends Event<{
  collectionName: string;
}> {}

manager.addListener(
  ObjectInsertedEvent,
  async e => {
    // Do something when the event
  },
  {
    filter: e => e.data.collectionName === "users",
  }
);
```

This is just a shorthand function so it allows your handler to focus on the task at hand rather than conditioning execution.

### Listeners

In order to listen to events we have to register them somehow. This is why we introduce the concept of "warmup" for listeners.

```typescript
import { Listener, On } from "@kaviar/core";

// The base Listener class has a init() function that registers the events accordingly
class NotificationListener extends Listener {
  @On(UserAddedEvent, {
    /* order, filter */
  })
  onUserAdded(e: UserAddedEvent) {
    // Do something
  }
}
```

All listeners must be warmed up for them to work.

## Warming Up

Warming up instantiates the specific Service, and if the `init()` function exists it will be called.
For example, you might use this for a DatabaseConnection, you want to immediately connect and you implement this in the service's `init()` function.

```typescript
class AppBundle extends Bundle {
  async init() {
    await this.warmup([NotificationListener]);
  }
}
```

## Bundles

Ok, now that you've learned the basics of containers and async event management, it's time to understand where all logic lies (inside the bundles)

### Configuration

Bundles can have a specific configuration to them and this is passed when instantiating them:

```ts
type Config = {
  subscriptionFee: number;
  currency: string;
};

class SaaSBundle extends Bundle<Config> {
  async init() {
    // You have access to the configuration in here: this.config
  }
}

kernel.addBundle(
  new SaaSBundle({
    subscriptionFee: 100,
    currency: "USD",
  })
);
```

You can also specify a default configuration for your bundle. The config you pass when constructing the bundle gets merged deeply with `defaultConfig`.

```ts
class SaaSBundle extends Bundle<Config> {
  defaultConfig = {
    currency: "USD",
  };
}
```

Another feature regarding configuration is providing a required config. A config that you must always pass:

```ts
type RequiredConfig = {
  subscriptionFee: number;
};

class SaaSBundle extends Bundle<Config, RequiredConfig> {}

new SaaSBundle({
  // Must be provided
  subscriptionFee: 100,
});
```

We decided to make this split because we want developers to force a specific value for a bundle that wouldn't be feasible to have it in `defaultConfig`.

You can also have more complex validation logic via `validate()`:

```ts
class SaaSBundle extends Bundle<Config, RequiredConfig> {
  async validate(config) {
    // Ensure that the provided config is ok
    // Throw an exception if it's not ok.
  }
}
```

### Lifecycle

Right now you've seen that bundles get initialised via the `init()` async function. But there's more to it because we wanted to allow bundles to work together and extend each other.

```typescript
class MyBundle extends Bundle<MyBundleConfig> {
  // This runs first and you can hook to bundle events
  // For example (before or after a specific bundle initialises)
  async hook() {}

  // Here you can basically prepare for initialisation, for example registering listeners, etc
  // You can regard this as container-preparation phase.
  async prepare() {}

  // The final step in the bundle's lifecycle. This is where bundles usually start event loops (you start express), or connect to the database
  async init() {}
}
```

Kernel also emits the following events (name descriptive enough), and listeners are run in-sync:

- KernelBeforeInitEvent
- BundleBeforePrepareEvent
- BundleAfterPrepareEvent
- BundleBeforeInitEvent
- BundleAfterInitEvent
- KernelAfterInitEvent

### Hooking

So, in theory you have the chance to hook even more to the bundles you love:

```ts
import {
  Bundle,
  Events,
  EventManager,
  Event,
  BundleAfterPrepareEvent,
} from "@kaviar/core";

class MyBundle extends Bundle {
  hook() {
    // Let's say you want to do stuff, after MyOtherBundle gets prepared.
    const manager = this.container.get(EventManager);

    manager.addListener(
      BundleAfterPrepareEvent,
      async e => {
        // Do something
      },
      {
        filter: e => e.data.bundle instanceof MyOtherBundle,
      }
    );
  }
}
```

### Credentials and Keys

Let's say we have a bundle that needs an API key, for example, `MailBundle` needs some authentication parameters. The way we connect Bundle's config to the container is by setting some constants into the container which the services use in their instantiation.

```typescript
import { Inject, Service, Token, Bundle } from "@kaviar/core";

// {bundle}/constants.ts
const Constants = {
  API_KEY: new Token(),
};

// {bundle}/services/MailService.ts
@Service()
class MailService {
  constructor(@Inject(Constants.API_KEY) protected readonly apiKey: string) {}

  send() {
    // access this.apiKey
  }
}

// {bundle}/{bundle}.ts
interface IMailBundleConfig {
  apiKey: string;
}

class MailBundle extends Bundle<IMailBundleConfig> {
  async prepare() {
    // We do this in prepare() phase
    this.container.set(Constants.API_KEY, this.config.apiKey);
  }
}
```

## Exceptions

It's nice to never rely on string matching to see which exception was thrown, and it's nice to have typesafety as well. We recommend you always use this instead of the standard `Error`. The reason we changed the name to `Exception` instead of Error was to avoid confusion that these class would somehow extend the `Error` class.

```typescript
import { Exception } from "@kaviar/core";

class UserNotAuthorizedException extends Exception<{
  userId: string;
  context: string;
}> {
  getMessage() {
    const { userId, context } = this.data;

    return `User with id ${userId} was denied access while trying to access: ${context}`;
  }
}

throw new UserNotAuthorizedException({
  userId: "123",
  context: "viewUserProfile",
});
```

```typescript
try {
  viewUserProfile(profileId, { userId });
} catch (e) {
  if (e instanceof UserNotAuthorizedException) {
    // Do something, send an email!
  }
}
```

## Advanced Bundles

Keep your bundle easily modifiable by allowing injection of customised services. The strategy is to use an `abstract class` as a placeholder, but there are other solutions as well.

:::note When would you like to do this?
This would be suited when you expose a bundle in which you allow a certain service to be overriden.
:::

Let's think of a bundle that does some security thingies and they want to allow you to inject a custom hash function.

```typescript
abstract class HashService {
  hash(str: string) {
    return md5(str);
  }
}

// a placeholder, or declare hash abstract and implement it here, your choice or a mixture of both depending on the use-case
class DefaultHashService extends HashService {}

class SecurityBundle extends Bundle<{ hasher: HashService }> {
  static defaultConfig = {
    hasher: DefaultHashService,
  };

  prepare() {
    // We bind HashService, to use a different constructor
    this.container.set({ id: HashService, type: this.config.hasher });
  }
}

// adding it when you instantiate the bundle
kernel.addBundle(
  new SecurityBundle({
    hasher: ExtendedHashService,
  })
  // Now every service that depends on HashService will be overriden
);
```

This strategy is to explicitly state which hasher you want in the constructor, but in real-life scenarios, you'll most likely do this inside your own `AppBundle`:

```typescript
class SecurityExtensionBundle extends Bundle {
  async hook() {
    const manager = this.container.get(EventManager);

    // Before SecurityBundle is prepared, I can either modify the config
    manager.addListener(
      BundleBeforePrepareEvent,
      e => {
        const { bundle } = e.data;

        // We use the `updateConfig` command
        bundle.updateConfig({
          hasher: MyExtendedHasher,
        });
      },
      {
        filter: e => e.data.bundle instanceof SecurityBundle,
      }
    );
  }
}
```

This strategy may feel a bit obscure as you allow any bundle to modify the config at any stage, if you want to prevent such things happening to your bundle, you can do something like:

```typescript
class SecurityBundle extends Bundle {
  updateConfig() {
    throw new Error(
      `Please use the exposed methods of this bundle to override config.`
    );
  }

  setHasher(hasher: HashService): void {
    Object.assign(this.config, { hasher });
  }
}

// And now you call setHasher instead of updateConfig.
```

:::info
If you want to have more control over the `setHasher` you can use `bundle.phase` to ensure that it is set within the preparation or initialisation phase.
