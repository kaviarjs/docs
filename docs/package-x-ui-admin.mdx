This is the place where you configure your enterprise level applications Administration interface. This bundle makes use of `@kaviar/x-ui`, so it is best if you familiarise yourself with it first.

This bundle uses `Ant Design` to leverage its Admin interface. Allowing you to focus on creating Menu Routes that can be role-dependent. This enables `Wordpress-like` functionality where external bundles that you just add to your `Kernel` extend the menu nicely.

## Basics:

```tsx
// kernel

kernel.addBundles([new XUIBundle(), new XUIAdminBundle()]);
```

## UI

Let's explore a bit about the structure, by creating our first layout:

```tsx title="components/Layout.tsx"
import { useUIComponents } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

// This is to illustrate how you can have a custom layout:
function Dashboard() {
  const Components = useUIComponents();

  return (
    <Components.AdminLayout content={}>
      <h1>Hello world!</h1>
    </Components.AdminLayout>
  );
}
```

Now we need to create a route, and because we don't rely on strings for routing, we should read them from a separate place, and register them in our bundle:

```tsx title="routes.ts"
import { IRoute } from "@kaviar/x-ui";

export const DASHBOARD = {
  path: "/dashboard",
  component: Dashboard,
  // optionally require certain roles that you can define in a Roles enum
  roles: [Roles.ADMIN],
  menu: {
    icon: RightOutlined, // Use any from: https://ant.design/components/icon/
    key: "DASHBOARD", // a unique name
    label: "Dashboard",
    order: 0, // If you want it to hold priority. The menus will be sorted by order, otherwise, by the order they have been added into the menu
  },
};
```

This is done only once, but ensure you load your routes in bundle init:

```ts
// In your bundle:
import * as Routes from "./routes";

export class UIAppBundle extends Bundle {
  async function init() {
    const router = this.container.get(XRouter);

    router.add(Routes);
  }
}
```
